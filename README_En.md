# Book Introduction

This book helps you to create the digital games you love to play, using a non-technical approach to game design without the need for programming or artistic experience.

Award-winning author Tracy Fullerton demystifies the creative process with clear and accessible guidance on the formal, dramatic, and dynamic systems of game design. Using examples of classic and popular games, illustrations of design techniques, and refined exercises to strengthen your understanding of how game systems function, the book gives you the skills and tools necessary to create a compelling and engaging game.

# The Purpose of this Project
​	The Game Design Workshop is an extremely professional game design textbook. I want to learn how to scientifically design games through the methodologies presented in the book. The purpose of this project is primarily to complete and document the exercises provided in the book. Additionally, I hope to find fellow readers to fork and share the exercise solutions, as these exercises often do not have a single correct answer. I am interested in seeing different interpretations of game design

​	If you are genuinely interested in forking and submitting exercises, simply create your own exercise folder. For example, my exercise book is called 'Wilson's Exercise Book
